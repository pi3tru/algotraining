# Knapsack Problem
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
Return total value and indices of items in the knapsack.

### Sample input
```
items = [
    {value = 1, weight = 2},
    {value = 4, weight = 3},
    {value = 5, weight = 6},
    {value = 6, weight = 7}
]

capacity = 10
```

### Sample output
```
{value = 10, itemIndices = [1, 3]}
```
